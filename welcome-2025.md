# Welcome to the 2025 Adelphi Dolphins

Hi everyone!  It's time for another year of Adelphi swimming and the ultimate volunteer job, officiating!  Thank you, in advance, for volunteering this year to officiate.


Welcome to the many newcomers: Sandi, Henry, Steven and Zach. And welcome back to Jen, James, and Elisabeth.
Naomi (officials coordinator, team rep) and I (head official) are also returning.  

Here are some links to cover some of the logistics (I do need some updates!) and details.
 
* For everyone: https://github.com/dbadrak/adelphi-dolphins/blob/main/officials.md
* For starters: https://github.com/dbadrak/adelphi-dolphins/blob/main/timers.md

If you've got any questions after going through these, please let me know and I can update the document. Any questions at all.

If you are going to be a starter/referee, please bring a whistle on a lanyard. Unfortunately, I do not have any extras.

Some abbreviations:

* ST -- stroke and turn judge
* SR -- starter
* DR -- deck referee
* CJ -- chief judge (turn end adjudicating DQs and then presenting to the DR for speeding up the meet)

About Saturday, June 7 2025: Time Trials.

This will start promptly at 8:30, and we have to be done by 12pm. We will swim the butterfly, freestyle, breaststroke and backstroke. There will be no IM and no relays.
Naomi and I are assembling positions schedules. For ST, we are attempting to give you visibility into each stroke from both start and turn end. For the new officials, we intend there to be an experienced ST at each and
along with a CJ to help. For SR/DR/CJ, we intend to give you at least one stroke at each position.  I will be at the start end answering questions, guiding and helping and officiating.  We do have a time limit,
so we need to be sure we are moving along well. There are 133 swimmers for trials.

 
We will have a stroke briefing before the meet. These typically are at 8:00 for an 8:30 start, but I'd like to start at 7:45 as we have a lot to cover and a lot of new positions and officials.  This way, the SR/DR will be able to do the
timer briefing (pretty straight forward -- we usually do not need to do this at Adelphi because we have an experienced head timer, but at an away meet the DR usually asks the SR to do this; I do want to give the SR/DR team a chance to
go through this briefing if we have the time). The meeting will be by the baby pool, at picnic tables along the fence across from the lower level restrooms.  If you can't find this place, look for me, I'll have the white polo with an orange bucket hat.


PMSL follows USA Swimming rules.  Please give these a read before Saturday. It is good to have them fresh. For the rule book, the glossary and rules are the important stuff.  You do not need to worry about pool specifications, records, or masters rules.  Look at the rules section in the handbook. There are a couple changes from last year (no smoking, ST presence on the deck), but I don't feel these will be an issue for us.
