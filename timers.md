# Adelphi Dolphins Timers Information

* [PVS Timer Briefing](https://www.pvswim.org/official/training/TimersBriefing.pdf)

* Thank you for timing!
* Timer briefing at 8:00am. The meet will start at 8:30. Please in position by 8:25.
* Please check in with the data table when you arrive. This will be on deck by the slide.  Write your name and team in a specific lane slot allocated to your team.
* Bring a refillable water bottle and stay hydrated.
* Wear a hat.
* Use sunscreen.
* Have a rain jacket handy in case the weather turns poor.
* There are 1 home and 2 visitor timers in a home team lane (even), and 2 home and 1 visitor timer in the visitor lane (odd).
* Three timers per lane, each with a stopwatch.
* Everyone will start the watch on the strobe on the starting device, even if no one in your lane.
* Record the times in the same person order each time.
* If the swimmer does not show, or there is no swimmer, write "NS" in one of time slots for that swimmer.
* If you are not supposed to have a swimmer, but one shows up, get their name (before if possible), and record their time. They have likely
been reseeded, but they may also be in the wrong heat.
* The coping stones have a 1/2 inch lip from the wall.
* You will need to step fully to the edge and lean over to see the wall due to the 1/2 inch lip.
* At the start end, stay back for the start.  The starter needs a clear view of the swimmers.
* If the watch doesn't start, or you miss the start, raise your hand and the head timer will swap out a watch.
* For 25m events (8U events, 10U butterfly), the timers will move to the turn end, which will be the finish end for the swimmers. 
* All othe events will have the timers at the start end (under the tents).  Please note there are 100m events (freestyle, IM and 8U relay) and 200m events
(medley relay and graduated freestyle relays).
* There will be a 5 minute break after the IM and before the freestyle relays.  Please be back in position promptly.
* Turn your phone to silent or off. If you must take a call, alert the head timer and they will fill in or find a substitute.
* For backstroke, timers may not provide legs for swimmers.
* Please return the watches and clipboards to the data table upon completion of the meet.
