# Adelphi Dolphins Officials Information

## Prepartion 

* standard uniforms: navy shorts, pants or skirt; white polo top
* bring a refillable water bottle and stay hydrated
* wear a hat
* perhaps have some snacks in your pocket
* be flexible. This is our first meet with the new pool configuration and logistics have been upheaved. Some stuff may change on the fly.  Becky and other are working super hard to make sure we've got a smooth meet, but this is a trial for operating a meet as much as for times
* we will have our officials briefing at 7:45am.  Normally, it will be 8:00am. This is a bit earlier than normal to go over things as much has changed. Where this will be, I'm not certain yet. We'll have an announcement.
* Please check in with the data table when you arrive. This will be on deck by the slide.
* we will be running all 5 strokes (fly, free, breast, back and IM). The plan is to also run the 8U relays.  Other relays are possible but unlikely.
* please give the rule book a re-read before tomorrow

  * also, the PMSL handbook: https://princemont.org/2023/2023_PMSL_Handbook.pdf
* if you are running late or for some reason can't make it, please let me know
* please jot down some notes or keep track of thoughts during the meet about how things are running, and offer up some feedback post meet.  Stuff we did well, stuff less well, etc.

## Pool Details

* The pool is 25m, with backstroke flags at 5m on both ends.
* The start end is closest to the fence. The turn end is closest to the pool house. There are 6 lanes.
* The lane lines are marked in red for 15m (each direction). We'll have a marking on the pool deck (by the diving boards) for 15m. We may observe this with a CJ during meets, but not likely tomorrow.  We'll use the red marks and it has to be definitive.
* We will not walk for stroke in  any event, as this new layout does not permit it

## Jursidiction

* Four S&T will be used, two at each end.
* Each S&T will watch 3 lanes and half the pool.
* S&T will be positioned as follows
  * lanes 1,2,3 on the line between 2 and 3 (two lanes to one side, one to the other)
  * lanes 4,5,6 on the line between 4 and 5 (two lanes to one side, one to the other)
* Freestyle events will have S&T at corners (lane 1 and lane 6 sides), watching that the swimmer touches the wall.
* S&T will rotate after events (6 total event/event groups, 4 total rotations).  After the break, S&T will return to their positions held during IM
  * after butterfly
  * after free
  * after breast
  * after back
  * do IM, break, relays, then done
* We will do the MR to start, and then all individual events, including the 100m IM, and then we will have a break. We no longer need to reconfigure the pool.
* After the break we will do the 8U relay and the 200 FR
* For relay take off judging, we will watch all 6 lanes (from the outsides) vs 3 and 3 (it's just too crammed for that).  We will need:
  * 200m MR -- 2 judges start end (starter/ref, or if we have multiple extra S&T we will use them as needed)
  * 100m 8U FR -- 2 judges start end, 2 judges turn end.  The S&T will act as takeoff judges.
  * 200m FR -- 2 judges, start end. The S&T will act as takeoff judges.
* We have 3 home meets and 2 away meets, and time trials (another home meet)
* If we want to use a CJ (turn side) we need to get agreement from the other team. I don't think this will be an issue.  It would speed up the breaststroke
* The S&T will need to spot and call out
  * improper suits
  * any sort of support tape
